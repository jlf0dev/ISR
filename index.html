				<p>This website will soon offer a new consumer product designed specifically to alert people to dangerous geological and human made events. This newly developed product by Infrasignal Radio LLC has been designed to give the individual consumer the ability to locally detect infrasignals caused by such things as earthquakes, mudslides, tsunamis, flash floods and manmade EMP. The radio also has other uses such as, detecting oil well fracking, sonic booms, listening to elephants, whales and other very large animals communicate.</p>

				<p id="earthquakes" class="nd-tab nd-active">If you live in an area that’s prone to deadly earthquakes, this new Infrasignal Radio could save your life. A little knowledge of geology here. When an earthquake occurs, it produces vibrational waves in all directions. The wave that travels mostly horizontal and directly toward a distance point from the epicenter is referred to as the primary wave, while the wave that travels up, down and mostly sideways is referred to as the secondary wave. Because the secondary wave takes a longer route than the primary wave, it arrives  later, maybe several seconds later. The primary wave can be very subtle and doesn‘t do much damage, if any. Sometimes it’s not even noticed. Then along comes the secondary wave and rocks your world. This is the one that does the most damage. Now, because the primary wave travels more direct and arrives before the secondary wave, if you had been alerted when the primary wave arrived, you may have been given precious seconds to get to safety before the secondary wave destroyed the building you were in.</p>
				<p id="mudslides" class="nd-tab">If you live on a steep slope overlooking a beautiful valley or ocean front and where the local soil permits, there’s always a danger of a mudslide after a heavy rain or when triggered by an earthquake when the ground is saturated with water. In the United States in the past 25 years, most people killed by mudslides were buried alive while they slept in their beds. The mudslides occurred at night and the people didn’t hear them coming. Mudslides and mudflows usually start small and build with debris as they flow downhill. Because of the tremendous weight of the mud, large boulders, trees and other debris flowing downhill, the mudslide creates a very low frequency rumble and vibrates the ground for miles ahead of the flow. This vibration is easily detected by the Infrasignal Radio which sounds the alarm.</p>
				<p id="tsunamis" class="nd-tab">If you live along a coast line and close to sea level in many parts of the world, tsunamis are always a possibility. In 2004 a magnitude 9.1-9.3 underwater earthquake near Indonesia created a tsunami that killed an estimated 230,000 to 280,000 people in ten different countries around the Indian Ocean. Noted among the survivors were elephants that were close to the shoreline just before the tsunami hit. The elephants fled to higher ground. It is believed the elephants heard the very low frequency rumble of the surf and felt the vibrations in the ground caused by the rushing seawater over the rough topography of the seabed and reefs. If people could have heard the low frequency rumble or felt the vibrations in the ground, maybe a lot fewer would have died.</p>
				<p id="flashFloods" class="nd-tab">According to the National Weather Service website, flash floods are the nation’s #1 weather-related killer in the United States. Flash floods can be caused by several things, heavy rainfall, broken dams, etc. One thing they all have in common, they come in a flash and most of the time, bring debris with them. Similar to mudslides, flash floods contain a lot of mass, they’re heavy and create a lot of vibration in the ground as they flow downhill. Also, flash floods can be much faster than mudslides so people have less time to escape to safety. The earlier the warning, the better.</p>
